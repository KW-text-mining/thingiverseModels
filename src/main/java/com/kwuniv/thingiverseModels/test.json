So, thank you.\r\n\r\nHowever, it wasn't enough for everyone. For some, there is only one sword that matters.

My banana sword—with its tiny, fragile pins that barely fit in thoose bizarrely angled holes—could never stand up to THE sword. The ONLY sword. The Master Sword… whatever that is.\r\n\r\nCreativity is dead. Long live recycled ideas based off grainy reference images I found on the Zelda Wiki. \r\n\r\nThe Master Sword is longer, bigger, heavier, and more intricate. The full length matches my 39\" banana sword, or can be increased to 48\" by adding two more components in the blade stackup. I've allowed all different-colored components of the sword to print separately, so you can bring your make as close to—or far from—in-game colors as you wish, without the need for paint. Oh, and the news you've all been waiting for: No more pins inside the blade. I've got something much better this time. \r\n\r\nPlease enjoy this sword. Good luck figuring out Zelda's legend, or whatever it is you do. I have no idea what the game is about. \r\n\r\nAlso, I started a Patreon for those who feel VERY strongly about my work.

For makers with high-precision printers, \"B#-tighter-dovetail\" files have been added as of 3/6/2023 and have a dovetail tolerance of 0.005\" as opposed to the original 0.015\".</p>\n<p>1) Stack and join \"B1\", \"B3\", \"B7\", and \"B9\" in order using \"P\" components, which press into their slots on the back of \"B#\" components. If making the longer blade, add one \"B4-6\" between \"B3\" and \"B7\", and join it with another \"P\". This consitutes the Odd side of the blade.<br>\n2) Stack and join \"B2\", \"B4-6\", and \"B8\" in order using \"P\" components as in step 1. If making the longer blade, add one \"B4-6\" next to the one already in the stack, and join it with another \"P\". This constitutes the Even side of the blade.<br>\n3) Slide both Even and Odd sides of the blade together. Keep them together with the \"P\" components. The full blade should now be rigid, aside from the sides sliding along one another.<br>\n4) Slide both \"T\" components into the slots at the bottom of the blade. The wider arrow-shaped side of each should face the bottom of the blade.<br>\n5) Hold \"H1\" and \"H2\" onto the bottom of the blade so that they fit together. Slide \"V\" into the hole at the bottom of \"H#\", and insert it fully. Only a fraction of an inch of component \"V\" should remain exposed.<br>\n6) Attach \"G\" components. This step is hard to put into words. If you can operate a 3D-printer, you can figure this one out. Call it a fun little challenge.<br>\n7) Slide \"X\" onto \"D\" and screw \"E\" onto \"D\".<br>\n8) Screw assembly XDE onto \"H#\". Be gentle and don't rush. Hold the wide end of \"D\" (not \"E\") to avoid breakage. If needed, disassemble and screw \"D\" in and out of \"H#\" a few times to smooth-out the threads.<br>\n9) Your sword is complete. Feel free to show your thanks via the \"Tip Designer\" button, or become a Patron and tell me what to make next.</p></div></div>\n",

If making the longer blade, add one \"B4-6\" between \"B3\" and \"B7\", and join it with another \"P\". This consitutes the Odd side of the blade.<br>\n2) Stack and join \"B2\", \"B4-6\", and \"B8\" in order using \"P\" components as in step 1. If making the longer blade, add one \"B4-6\" next to the one already in the stack, and join it with another \"P\". This constitutes the Even side of the blade.<br>\n3) Slide both Even and Odd sides of the blade together. Keep them together with the \"P\" components. The full blade should now be rigid, aside from the sides sliding along one another.<br>\n4) Slide both \"T\" components into the slots at the bottom of the blade. The wider arrow-shaped side of each should face the bottom of the blade.<br>\n5) Hold \"H1\" and \"H2\" onto the bottom of the blade so that they fit together. Slide \"V\" into the hole at the bottom of \"H#\", and insert it fully. Only a fraction of an inch of component \"V\" should remain exposed.<br>\n6) Attach \"G\" components. This step is hard to put into words. If you can operate a 3D-printer, you can figure this one out. Call it a fun little challenge.<br>\n7) Slide \"X\" onto \"D\" and screw \"E\" onto \"D\".<br>\n8) Screw assembly XDE onto \"H#\". Be gentle and don't rush. Hold the wide end of \"D\" (not \"E\") to avoid breakage. If needed, disassemble and screw \"D\" in and out of \"H#\" a few times to smooth-out the threads.<br>\n9) Your sword is complete. Feel free to show your thanks via the \"Tip Designer\" button, or become a Patron and tell me what to make next.</p></div>\n"
